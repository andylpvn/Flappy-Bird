# Flappy-Bird

A C# game based on the concept of side-scrolling mobile games featuring 2D retro-style graphics (credit to Nguyen Ha Dong - a Vietnamese developer). this C# application is designed to remove the boredness of any person. 

The interesting feature of this application is that the bird briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, the flying bird falls because of gravity; each pipe that it navigates between earns the player a single point. 

The user has to use the space bar to tap the bird. If the bird strikes with the pipes, the player loses the game
